# NotifyBot - Core Plugin and Add-Ons

An old project of mine from 2016. Sent multiple notifications when things happened in WordPress.

I know I have a few different revisions of this sitting around and have no idea which this one is. This might be the WIP one or it could be one that was fully functional.

Based on the amount of changed to WordPress since this was made, it's probably broken in at least a few ways. Maybe someone can make a cool notification plugin out of it or something. If you do, let me know.

Main plugin is here, as well as add-ons for different notification types. It was made to be extensible, so if someone wants to revive it, they can easily extend it too.

I might be open to rebuilding it myself if there's interest.
