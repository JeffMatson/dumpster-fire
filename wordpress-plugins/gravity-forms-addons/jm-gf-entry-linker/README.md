# jm-gf-entry-linker

Another quick and dirty solution that I wrote ages ago and fell under my "if I can release it, you get later patches" agreement. Now that I think about it, I think this client ran out of money before the rest of the project completed anyways.

If I recall correctly, this Gravity Forms add-on linked together multiple fields to auto-fill form fields based on prior submissions or some other meta.

It's not likely to work as-is because of how long ago it was and might have other dependencies. Hell, I don't know if it's even finished, but you might be able to get something out of it.
