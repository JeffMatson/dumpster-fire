# Gravity Forms Body Part Selector

Back when I did freelance projects, I would give the client an option to benefit from bugfixes if released, but I never got around to doing anything with it. So here you go - an old, most likely broken plugin.

It's a Gravity Forms add-on that creates a field for selecting body parts.

Like I said, it was written ages ago, so it's unlikely to work properly as-is. The JS is a pretty hacky anyways for today's standards. Anyways, maybe someone can use something in it.

## Usage

1. Install the plugin.
2. Add the Body Part Selector field to your form (under Advanced fields).
3. Set the URL to the image you want to use.
4. Set the ACTUAL height and width of the image you're using. Don't worry, the code will scale it.
5. Access your form.

Note: This may not be accessible from the Form Preview.
