# Gravity Forms Entry Approval

I can't remember why or when I wrote this, but it'll let you approve or deny a Gravity Forms entry. Looks like it was a one-off for something.

My guess is that it probably won't work with current version of Gravity Forms as-is, but who knows. It's at least a concept.
