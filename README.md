# Jeff Matson's Dumpster Fire

I write a lot of crap, either to solve a quick problem or as part of another project. Occasionally, I come across people who could use some of it. Therefore, the dumpster fire repo was born.

## Things You Should Know

- I'll try to categorize things the best I can. That said, if you're looking for something and find it where you wouldn't expect it, feel free to document it somewhere. Pull requests always welcome.
- Whatever you're looking for should be assumed to be hot garbage. While some things could be considered production-ready by many standards, I make no promises. This isn't meant to contain anything comprehensive - only as a starting point. Treat it as such.
- If something is hot garbage and you want to improve it, feel free to open a pull request. Just ebcause I can't be bothered to fix it doesn't mean someone else wouldn't appreciate it.
- Most of what I'll be dropping in here is undocumented. Take it for what it is. If you want to put in the effort to document something, go for it and shoot me a pull request. Either inline, a `README.md` at the the root directory, or elsewhere is cool with me. 
- Once again, you've been warned that this is a dump of crap that was either a stupid side project, a proof of concept, a quick fix, or all of the above. Don't be dumb - know what you're deploying if you decide to use any of this.
- Feel free to open issues if something is broken or doesn't make any sense. I'll try to help if I can. No promises though - this stuff was abandoned for a reason.
- Have fun and enjoy. If I helped you out with something, let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheJeffMatson).
